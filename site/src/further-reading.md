Checkout the [`rust-analyzer` style guide](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/blob/master/docs/dev/style.md).
Note that those style guidelines are intended for a single project, hence it is possible for its developers to make more specific requirements which only make sense in the context of that project, unlike the guidelines provided here.
